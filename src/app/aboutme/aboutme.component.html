<p class="description">  I am a researcher of sociotechnical systems with a focus on online governance. Broadly, I work
  towards making computer-mediated social lives richer, healthier, and more dignified.
<p class="description">
  My postdoctoral experience includes appointments at Virginia Tech and
  at the GESISâ€”Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, where I am the Team Leader for Data Science Methods
  at the Computational Social Science Department.
  I received my PhD in CSE from the University of Padua, where I studied how nonverbal communication
  shapes online discussions.

<p class="description">I develop models to identify and characterize fringe behaviors that threaten collective well-being,
  such as trolling, sexism, and conspiracy theories. I also study the practices around regulating fringe
  behavior, such as managing differences in norms across-communities, expanding peer moderation practices beyond
  sanctioning and censoring, and developing computational models to mitigate the underprovision of human moderators. I find
  this dual outlook, on fringe behavior and its regulation, helpful for developing a critical mind for how online
  platforms and cultures create unique affordances for toxicity and misinformation. </p>
